# UnimanualReaching_Simulation
Simulation of reaching with one hand in a straight line.

**Reaching Task**
1. The task is to move a the hand from start state (position, velocity) = (0,0) to a target state (position, velocity) = (8,0).
2. The hand chooses one of the three acceleration actions  (-1, 0, 1) at each step of movement.
3. At each step the action is chosen in an epsilon-greedy manner and receives a reward.
